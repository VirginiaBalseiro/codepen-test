      <p>
        In June 2021, the Solid Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Team (DEIT)
        launched the first official Solid Community Survey. </p>
        <p>As the Solid
        community continues to grow, we want to be able to include and support
        people of all backgrounds, industries, and identities. </p>

        <h3 class="subheader-gold">What were our goals?</h3>
        <p> 
          Through the
        survey, we wanted to learn about the members who comprise the community,
        discover issues people might be facing within the community, and how to
        make the community stronger, more welcoming, and ultimately, larger.
