  <h1 id="Solid-Community-Survey-Results" >Solid Community Survey Results</h1>
  <h2 id="Introduction" >Introduction</h2>
  <p>In June 2021, the Solid Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Team (DEIT) launched the first official Solid Community Survey. As the Solid community continues to grow, we want to be able to include and support people of all backgrounds, industries, and identities. Through the survey, we wanted to learn about the members who comprise the community, discover issues people might be facing within the community, and how to make the community stronger, more welcoming, and ultimately, larger.</p>
